**Primary Aim** 
- Utilise structure tokenizer and codebook to generate embeddings for protein pockets. 

**Objectives** 

1) Conduct a consistency check across multiple similar structures to validate reliability.

2) Generate token embeddings for known binding pockets (688 pairs the HOLO4K-AlphaFold2 Paired)

3) Benchmark against SOTA descriptors. (FPocket, LIGSITE, DEEPSITE) 

4) Evaluate protein similarity using various metrics. Train a model specifically for binding pocket analysis.
